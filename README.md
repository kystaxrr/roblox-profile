// ! VIEW YOUR CURRENT AVATAR THUMBNAIL CUSTOMIZATIONS: https://avatar.roblox.com/v1/avatar/thumbnail-customizations  // ! This script is using the API of an intentional feature, it's not a bug. Roblox may disable the ability for the thumbnail generator to use thumbnail customizations **at any time**. // ! The API was enabled two times before the Profile Picture Editor in the app was enabled; see: https://twitter.com/RobloxTrackers/status/1512460262607048715 // ! You probably would only get terminated if you get caught using the feature inappropriately.  /* !! After your first time of setting a thumbnail configuration, the thumbnail of that type can not go back to how it was originally. !! (i.e.: using Idle Animations, camera position). It can only be temporarily reverted if Roblox disables this feature again. */  // doing ajax because easy csrf handling w/their middleware lol $.ajax({   method: "POST",   url: "https://avatar.roblox.com/v1/avatar/thumbnail-customization",   contentType: "application/json",   data: JSON.stringify({     "camera": {         // Ranges are inclusive.
